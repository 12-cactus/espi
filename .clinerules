# Cline Rules for Espinoso Bot

## Code Style
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations strictly (already set up in project)
- Single quotes, 2-space indentation, 120 char line width
- Organize imports: builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling → index
- Alphabetize imports within groups
- Use arrow functions without parens when single parameter
- Prefix unused vars with underscore (_)

## TypeScript Conventions
- Use TypeScript types but avoid over-engineering
- No explicit function return types unless adding clarity
- Allow `any` when pragmatic (not dogmatic about types)
- Keep interfaces and types close to where they're used

## Project Structure
- Controllers: API/webhook handlers
- Core: Business logic (GPT, Holidays, Stickers, etc.)
- Helpers: Utility functions
- Lib: External service clients (GitHub, HTTP, logging)
- Exceptions: Custom error classes
- Keep separation of concerns clear

## Testing Philosophy
- Currently: Unit tests only (Jest)
- Future goal: Add integration test layer
- Test files in `__tests__/` directory
- Mock external services (using nock)
- Keep fixtures in `__tests__/__fixtures__/`

## Documentation (Work in Progress)
- TODO: Improve README with setup instructions
- TODO: Create bot usage documentation
- In code: Add comments when logic isn't obvious, but don't over-comment

## Communication Style
- Be technical but friendly
- Add some humor when appropriate 😄
- It's okay to express uncertainty - nobody knows everything
- Focus on learning together and teaching clearly
- Concise explanations, but thorough when needed
- No corporate speak or overly formal language

## Bot-Specific Guidelines
- This is "Espinoso" (unfriendly bot) - embrace the personality
- Handle Telegram webhooks through Express
- Use Winston for logging
- Environment variables via dotenv
- Keep webhook handling efficient (quick responses)
